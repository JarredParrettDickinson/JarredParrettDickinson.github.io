This is week one of the blog and the first week back from being sick over the holidays. Being sick over Christmas and New Years wasn't a fun time and took its toll. As for what I was sick with, it seemed to be a virus: symptoms included a 101+ fever, congestion and a headache. In the training days following, I found each run to be a grueling effort. With even the least amount of effort, my heart rate was driven up to that of something much faster than I would expect when I was healthy at that pace. At times, I struggled to maintain any momentum.

This caused some anxiety - a question of whether I would find my way back to my pre-sick fitness levels. I kept on it and stayed the course run after run. In this, the struggle was patience, and, if you know me, you know that in things like this I am not the most patient. In the end, however, I made my way back to the pre-sick levels.

## Days till race: 79

 * Total miles: 53.1
 * Longest run: 17.05
