I guess this one is better late than never. Here is a blog post for week 2 coming to you weeks after the actual training. This one is this late as I have been driving across the eastern-seaboard going from NC to NJ and on to CT. With each additional step of travel, I find that I am faced with a new challenge - training in a new place and environment. On top of that, on drives over 5 hours, I have been finding that there is a significant impact on training from the perspective of fatigue. Consistently, the first run following travel feels significantly more difficult as compared to similar runs done previously. Why is that? I am not 100% sure, but I suspect it could be a combination of things from being in a sedentary position when driving for a period of time to the difficulty eating and maintaining a reasonable diet when traveling.

While difficult, it was still a productive week with the opportunity to actually get out on the race trail. Using a GPX from a previous race, I managed to construct a map of the course to run when I was passing through Maryland. It was a cold one but a good exposure to the course. Takeaways from it were: manage climbs by just keep churning, I can probably get through a loop with just a handheld and the conditions are going to be their own challenge - it could be spring-like, cold or even snowing. Anyway, this is the map of it.


Training wise: it was a great week! I ran in everything from 75 degrees in NC to 4 degrees in CT. Each new environment had its own set of challenges but was rewarding all the same. The build continues.
