In a time where large firms are constantly competing to raise their bottom line and the battle for every ounce of profit, there does not seem to be an argument for them going out of their way to generate non-proprietary projects. However, the reality is quite the contrary, as we discussed within the class; the remarkable nature of the work by GNU and Stallman is that they have championed basic freedoms of a movement. A movement that is the foundation of much of today’s computing architecture. 

I find myself in awe at how they managed to have such significant forethought in a time of rapid development and a chance for tech fortunes. When one examines the historical leaders of the tech world, it is easy to look to Jobs, Gates and other magnates, but, perhaps the contributions of thought by community members like Torvald and Stallman dwarf that of them. This dichotomy follows the reading on the Cathedral and Bazaar as one can compare the contributions of Stallman and Torvald to that of the Bazaar approach while the notable tech giants are those of the Cathedral.

<ul>
<li>Reporting_Airline: Unique Carrier Code. When the same code has been used by multiple carriers, a numeric suffix is used for earlier users, for example, PA, PA(1), PA(2). Use this field for analysis across a range of years.</li>
<li>DOT_ID_Reporting_Airline: An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airline (carrier). A unique airline (carrier) is defined as one holding and reporting under the same DOT certificate regardless of its Code, Name, or holding company/corporation.</li>
<li>IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline	Code assigned by IATA and commonly used to identify a carrier. As the same code may have been assigned to different carriers over time, the code is not always unique. For analysis, use the Unique Carrier Code.</li>
<li>Tail_Number: Tail Number	</li>
<li>Flight_Number_Reporting_Airline: Flight Number</li>
</ul>
 <li>Origin	</li>
<ul>
<li>OriginAirportID: Origin Airport, Airport ID. An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport. Use this field for airport analysis across a range of years because an airport can change its airport code and airport codes can be reused.</li>
<li>OriginAirportSeqID: Origin Airport, Airport Sequence ID. An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport at a given point of time. Airport attributes, such as airport name or coordinates, may change over time.	</li>
<li>OriginCityMarketID: Origin Airport, City Market ID. City Market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a city market. Use this field to consolidate airports serving the same city market.	</li>
<li>Origin: Origin Airport</li>
<li>OriginCityName: Origin Airport, City Name</li>
<li>OriginState: Origin Airport, State Code</li>
<li>OriginStateFips: Origin Airport, State Fips</li>
<li>OriginStateName: Origin Airport, State Name</li>
<li>OriginWac: Origin Airport, World Area Code</li>
</ul>
<li>Destination			</li>
<ul>
<li>DestAirportID: Destination Airport, Airport ID. An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport. Use this field for airport analysis across a range of years because an airport can change its airport code and airport codes can be reused.		</li>
<li>DestAirportSeqID: Destination Airport, Airport Sequence ID. An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport at a given point of time. Airport attributes, such as airport name or coordinates, may change over time.		</li>
<li>DestCityMarketID: Destination Airport, City Market ID. City Market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a city market. Use this field to consolidate airports serving the same city market.		</li>
<li>Dest: Destination Airport		</li>
<li>DestCityName: Destination Airport, City Name		</li>
<li>DestState: Destination Airport, State Code		</li>
