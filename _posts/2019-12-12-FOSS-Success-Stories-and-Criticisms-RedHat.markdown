In the recent class discussion, a variety of models for open-source software were visited - from the “support-as-a-service” model of RedHat to the criticisms of the model by Peter Levine. While the discussion covered many points about the success of RedHat, there remains a question about what is the history of RedHat?

Today it is easy to see RedHat as a large, steadfast organization that dominates the intersection of open-source and the business space. RedHat was founded in Durham, North Carolina in 1993 by Marc Ewing through the release of a Linux distribution while in school at Carnegie Mellon. Following the release, Bob Young created the RedHat Software by merging it with his own software organization. In a few short years after that, RedHat had ascended to an incredible size which prompted the public offering of the company in 1999. While large today, it can be easily forgotten that it was not always like that. In fact, Bob Young still champions the humble beginnings that were RedHat in the early days.

While RedHat today may look like the open-source supporting business that so many rely on, is that in fact the case? RedHat has had a series of productive business movements that have propelled it to where it is today. From its IPO to its acquisition by IBM more recently in 2018. However, much like the stories of ride-sharing and social media empires, its existence was not foreseen. Therefore, contrary to Peter Levine,  is it not possible that this model, or perhaps a variation, may succeed somewhere else? I think it may be.
