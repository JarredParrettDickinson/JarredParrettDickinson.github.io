### AG DATA
Since leaving a position at an agriculture organization prior to attending Dickinson College, I found my interest has only grown within the space of agriculture. With that, I recently discovered what is a fun new hobby of data science after taking a class on it. Therefore, I thought why not marry the two and visualize AG data by county. Through using AG data from the USDA census and survey, I created the below notebook to employ a call to the USDA FTP server and retrieve economic data and then clean it for the display on a Plotly map. The notebook offers interactive widgets for the selection of data but does require some tinkering to update the plot. 

### Example
You can see, in the below chart, an example of **AG LAND, CROPLAND, (EXCL HARVESTED & PASTURED) - ACRES 2012**. 
{% include sample.html %}

### What are the variables?



You can see the notebook below and by clicking the line `open in CoLab` it will take you to your own notebook through google to run. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
